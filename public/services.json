        "description": "Retail food delivery is a courier service in which a restaurant, store, or independent food-delivery company delivers food to a customer. An order is typically made either through a restaurant or grocer's website or mobile app, or through a food ordering company. The delivered items can include entrees, sides, drinks, desserts, or grocery items and are typically delivered in boxes or bags. The delivery person will normally drive a car, but in bigger cities where homes and restaurants are closer together, they may use bikes or motorized scooters."

        "description": "The Global Courier and Delivery Services industry comprises two segments, which include larger couriers and smaller local delivery companies. Together, these segments provide air, surface and express courier delivery services of parcels, documents and packages to a wide variety of consumers. Over the past five years, many developments in the online retailing space have driven industry growth. However, internet use has diminished the need for shipment of some goods, such as documents that can be scanned and sent electronically. Over the five years to 2024, demand for courier and delivery services is expected to grow. Demand for high-end, time-sensitive goods will likely rise as a result of increased consumer spending."

The exception is still image files, which are not deliverable by FDS at this time. If the file delivered by FDS is natively supported by web browsers, it will display/play directly in the browser. For files not natively supported in the browser, the user will be prompted to save the file to a local computer where it can be opened and viewed using local rendering applications."
